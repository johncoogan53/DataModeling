# Statistics Reflection: How Eugenics Shaped Statistics

## Summary:

This article discusses the origins of many core statistical methods, how they were born from eugenicist ideologies, and how we may seek to decouple the methods from the philosophies of their inception. 

The article focuses on three prominent figures in statistics: Francis Galton, Karl Pearson, and Ronald Fisher. Specifically, how these individuals sought to utilize statistical models to highlight the differences between races. Most commonly referenced is the usage of normal distributions, significance testing, and chi-squared testing to demonstrate disparities in racial characteristics like intelligence.

These methods, divorced from their dubious origins, have become ubiquitous within the world of statistics as they provide powerful tools by which to analyze populations of interest. The statistics community is now confronted with common methods which justified the codification of deeply rooted racial thought in our society and how best to navigate their appropriate usage, or usage at all.

## Reflection:

### Confounding Variables:

What might be amusing, if it weren't so tragic and if it didn't have such a demonstrably insidious effect on social ideology throughout history, is that these paragons of statistics (due to motive bias or ignorance) categorically failed to recognize that there could be confounding variables in the association between something like intelligence and race. 

Confounding variables, something even novice statisticians are perpetually wary of, are some hidden variable that is driving a statistical correlation but is not accounted for in a model. These can lead to erroneous conclusions about statistical significance and, in this instance, were almost assuredly the cause for the conclusions described in the article. 

To take the example of intelligence associated with race, that there could be high degrees of association between ones race and intelligence at the time of study is not entirely difficult to believe. That one race's normal distribution for intelligence has a higher or lower mean value simply because of their race is cavalier at best, outright maliciously disingenuous at worst. The factors contributing to intelligence are so numerous that to attribute such a complex quantitative variable (assuming an appropriate metric for intelligence which is a problem in its own right) to just one associated variable is statistically irresponsible. The eugenicist philosophy made such associations across numerous characteristics habitually. 

### The Data does not speak for itself and never has:

At its core, the foundation of these eugenicist ideologies was that the numbers speak for themselves. If a statistical association can be demonstrated between two variables then that association is objective and irrefutable. 

This is most clear in Ronald Fisher's significance testing. Often referred to as a p-value or the likelihood that your data could have occurred under the null hypothesis (normally that no association exists). In short, if you get low p-values then there is association between the variables you are investigating. This is a tool however, not an answer. It is a qualitative test of whether association exists but does not serve to answer the questions of 'why?' or 'by how much?'.

It was the question of 'whether' which interested the eugenicist and not the 'why' or 'by how much' because highlighting racial differences was the goal. Moreover, attributing those differences explicitly to race would have been difficult if the question of 'why' was answered as it would have brought to the fore stronger associative variables for characteristics like socioeconomic status and subsequently education level/quality of education. Significance testing is an alluring value because it can "objectively" support associations that may confirm investigative biases. Without looking at the problem wholistically, one can easily fall prey to a narrow vision which leads to erroneous conclusions which seem to be rigorously and objectively verified. 

### The Impact of False Objectivity:

Statistical analysis of human populations is inherently subject to human elements of variability. By propagating racially prejudiced ideologies supported by statistically derived false objectivity, eugenicists influenced the sentiments of those individuals within the population who were exposed to that information. The information itself which, as we discussed above, is really a result of hidden variables like minority access to quality education and wealth producing careers, now becomes something of a self fulfilling prophecy as it deeply seeds the target population with prejudicial bias which compounds the the original findings. 

This is what I believe most people attempt to describe when they discuss the term Institutional Racism. It isn't that the administration of a given institution is subconsciously racist and it isn't solved by those individuals adopting racially progressive ideologies (although this is probably beneficial in its own right). The core issue is that the power dynamics that exist today, at least in part, draw their origins from this type of erroneous statistical analysis. The roots of these issues run deep. To solve the problem of minority representation in higher education, one must ask what are the admissions criterion and why do they disproportionately select for racial groups. This leads down a winding path of education quality, social capital, and other immensely complex issues that are exceedingly difficult to address. Problems like injecting generational wealth into low income communities require activism at the nexus of policy, culture, business, and many other organs of society. This is the legacy of eugenicist influence on statistics and is a wicked problem to course correct.

## Conclusion
This article is a case study in the perils of statistical inference. Whether Galton, Fisher, and Pearson set out to maliciously generate statistical backing to their prejudice or, more concerning, were indoctrinated by their own analysis of the human population into an ethos of racial prejudice is irrelevant. What is unquestionable is the power statistics can have on human sentiment and the damaging repercussions misuse can have.
